1) Prevention:
   This strategy can't be used in real-time systems, because it checks each request for a deadlock. It takes much time. In other systems it can be used.

2) Avoidance:
   This strategy makes deadlocks impossible, but it places extra restrictions which run in system, so this is complicated.

3) Recovery:
   This strategy deals with deadlock only when it occurs. It can kill some processes. However it requires some processes which can be restarted safely and without any ill effects.
